# Search
This is a small project I made to learn the basic search algorithms while following Prof. Patrick Winston's lectures on AI (MIT OpenCourseware)

# How to use :
Key | Usage
--------------|--------------
a | A-Star algorithm
b | Breadth-First-Search
d | Depth-First-Search
v | Best-First-Search
h | HillClimb
n | Djikstra
g | Generate maze (DFS + Backtracker)
Backspace | Clear Screen
s | set starting point
e | set end point
leftClick | Make wall
rightClick | Remove Wall

# Note:
- The program might have some bugs that i couldn't find, If you're unfortunate to encouter a bug please report it as an issue.
- This script will be updated in the future as the code is extremely redundent and not efficient for my liking.
